### Usage

* Enter an address or coordinate to get a mapcode, or move the map around.

* Tap twice on the map to zoom in really deep.

* Enter a mapcode in the address field to show it on the map. Tip: if you omit
the territory for local mapcodes, the current territory is used.

* Tap the `>>` buttons to show next territory or mapcode.

* Tap the mapcode itself to copy it to the clipboard.

* Tap on the `Maps` icon to plan a route to it using the Maps app.

* Tap on the `Share` button to share the mapcode with any other app.

* Note that a single location can have mapcodes with different territory codes.
  The 'correct' territory is always included, but other territories may be presented as well.

* You can select the correct territory by tapping on the `>>` button.

# Using Git and `.gitignore`

It's good practice to set up a personal global `.gitignore` file on your machine which filters a number of files
on your file systems that you do not wish to submit to the Git repository. You can set up your own global
`~/.gitignore` file by executing:
`git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore`

In general, add the following file types to `~/.gitignore` (each entry should be on a separate line):
`*.com *.class *.dll *.exe *.o *.so *.log *.sql *.sqlite *.tlog *.epoch *.swp *.hprof *.hprof.index *.releaseBackup *~`

If you're using a Mac, filter:
`.DS_Store* Thumbs.db`

If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, filter:
`*.iml *.iws .idea/`

If you're using Eclips, filter:
`.classpath .project .settings .cache`

If you're using NetBeans, filter:
`nb-configuration.xml *.orig`

The local `.gitignore` file in the Git repository itself to reflect those file only that are produced by executing
regular compile, build or release commands, such as:
`target/ out/`
